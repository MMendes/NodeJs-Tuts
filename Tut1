/*
 * use : cd "directory" to navigate in the console window (command window) to use nodeJs
 * you will have to insert each individual command to get to each directory until you reach the one where your
 * JavaScript file is located.
 * For example if your Js file is located in: C:\Users\"username"\Documents\NodeJs\Tuts\Tut1\sever.js
 * you would have to write: cd Documents (press Enter) - which would take you to the Documents directory
 * Then in the next line: cd NodeJs (press Enter) - which would take you to the Documents\NodeJs directory
 * and so on, until you reach the directory directly containing your JavaScript file.
 * It is only once you have reached this directory that you can type: "node server.js" in the command console
 * and then insert "localhost:8080" in the URL of your browser.
 * My first challenge to getting this to work was because I had never used the command console before, so everytime
 * I requested the server.js file on the console, it could never find the directory, thus never rendering the 
 * the message "Hello World!" on the browser.
 * The code above is written in a normal text editor and saved as a JavaScript file.
 * That's one of the advantages of NodeJs - It's written in JavaScript ;)
 * Good stuff!
