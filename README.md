NodeJs-Tuts
===========
I have decided to follow the tutorials from the following link:
http://nodetuts.com/

At this time I know close to nothing about Node.Js, but further information can be found at:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1884724/what-is-node-js

I will be adding the code from the tutorials from the first link with aditional notes that I find relevant, because I am using 
a Windows computer and some commands might be different on the command line of nodeJs.
